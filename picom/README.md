# Picom config

In this picom config, I use [this fork of picom](https://github.com/s0nny7/picom/tree/fix-shadow-clean)
which adds blur, rounded corners AND rounded shadows at the same time.

## Installation

Just follow the installation process of picom and copy the `picom.conf`
file in `~/.config/picom.conf`.

```bash
cp picom.conf "$HOME/.config/picom.conf"
```

## Special thanks

Thanks to sonny who made this fork, because without it, I'd still be trying to 
choose between rounded corners and shadows, and I would have gone crazy xD
